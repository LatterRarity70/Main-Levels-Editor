u can edit:
- main levels setup (stars, song, name, difficulty)
- bg color for page
- songs
- pages in level select layer (here is a fake page list)

<cg>summary u can add ur own level in level select layer</c>

Just open .geode file (its zip btw) and pack the config files up to `./config/` folder.
