### Temporary guide
To replace level:
- export your level in .level file
- rename it to `{id}.level` (like 1.level)
- put it to mod config folder
- reload game

To add as new one:
- export level
- copy its id (f.e. 1337)
- add id to level listing setting (**1337,**1-22,-2,-1)
- reload game

Its recommended to read level listing setting info.
